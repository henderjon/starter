# starter

Like using wild yeast to make bread, this repo is some starter/template code for
new projects and a place where I keep notes so I can find them later.

## static

A simple web server written in Go so that browsers will execute JS locally.

## php

My mother tongue.

## go

Stuff I enjoy writing.

## docker

It's so hot right now.
